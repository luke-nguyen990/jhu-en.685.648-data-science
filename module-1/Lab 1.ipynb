    "\n",
    "In this course, Labs are the chance to applying concepts and methods discussed in the module.\n",
    "They are a low stakes (pass/fail) opportunity for you to try your hand at *doing* data science.\n",
    "Everything you need to successfully complete the assignment was presented during the Module.\n",
    "Refer to specific sections and examples in *Fundamentals*.\n",
    "You should be demonstrating your understanding of the techniques, frameworks, and guidelines that we have presented.\n",
    "Through group discussion, the completion of the Lab, review of the Lab Solution, and Peer Review, you are solidifying your understanding of and confidence in the topic in preparation for the Problem Sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Science is as much about what you write (communicating) as the code you execute.\n",
    "In many places, you will be required to execute code and discuss both the purpose and the result.\n",
    "We summarize this requirement as \"discuss/code/discuss\".\n",
    "In short, there should always be a triple of Markdown/Code/Markdown cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Data Science is about reproducibility and transparency. \n",
    "This includes good communication with your team and possibly with yourself. \n",
    "Therefore, you must show **all** work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avail yourself of the Markdown/Codecell nature of the notebook. \n",
    "If you don't know about Markdown, look it up. \n",
    "Your notebooks should not look like ransom notes. Don't make everything bold. \n",
    "Clearly indicate what question you are answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will have cause to use specially formatted blocks such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"background: lemonchiffon; margin:20px; padding: 20px;\">\n",
    "    <strong>Special</strong>\n",
    "    <p>This is a special block. We use them to \"break character\" or \"break the 4th wall\".</p>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do not use them, ever, unless explicitly instructed to do so.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You should write succinctly, to the point, in prose.\n",
    "This is not a slide deck so don't use bullet points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit a cleanly executed notebook. \n",
    "The first code cell should say `In [1]` and each successive code cell should increase by 1 throughout the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You may add cells but **you must not delete any of them.**\n",
    "2. Submission of the Lab represents an attestation that you have adhered to the Academic Misconduct Policy of the Whiting School of Engineering and the assignment rules given during the Course Orientation and Syllabus."
